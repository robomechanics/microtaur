DISCLAIMER: Some of the motors do not work, if after following
this process you still cannot connect to the motor, it is as good
as dead, sorry. :(

Currently unsolved issue: motor can connect to UART, however,
we cannot connect it to our teensy, we have modified the Baud rate
and the firmware versions, neither worked :(


How to connect to motors:

1. Isolate motor onto USB to UART in order to get full access, a
microcontroller such as Arduino can only provide partial accessibility 
- (CAN'T UPDATE FIRMWARE WITHOUT UART)

	a. Connect TX on FPDI (for example) to RX on motor, and 
	RX on FPDI to TX on motor. And GND to GND
	
	b. Install IQ Control Center, and then click connect on top right
	with respective baud rate.
		i. if baud rate is causing issues, connect motor to arduino
		and follow directions on IQ instruction manual to find 
		the arduino code that can be used to connect to the motors
		using a custom baud rate. Then head to Advanced settings in
		IQ settings and change Baud rate.

		****You cannot access the motor control without modifying the
		baud rate, currently, the old motors are set to 500000, you
		must set it to your desired baud rate (i.e. 115200) through an arduino. 
		Then you can connect UART in order to flash new firmware*********

	c. To update motors, retrieve firmware .bin file from IQ website
	and then follow direction on IQ control center to update.
		i. to get specific update files, you can paste the 
		link address of the firmware file into the search bar 
		and then backspace the link until it leads to the parent
		directory, where you can find New files, old files, and 
		backup files. (If you have trouble with this, just email IT for the
		specific firmware version your looking for)


If you have any questions beyond this point, you can contact me at joshuara@andrew.cmu.edu, I'm more than happy to help you debug!

Hope this helps!
